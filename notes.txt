- n x n grid, top left to bottom right (down and right)
- H HP (if < 0 after moving to tile, game over)
- 4 tile types
    - 0: damage (lose d HP)
    - 1: heal (gain h HP)
    - 2: protection (can nullify next instance of damage)
    - 3: multiplier (can double next heal)

- can hold maximum of 1 multiplier and 1 protection token at once
- return boolean reporting if it's possible for player to finish game without game over
- O(n^2)

- python: can use numpy/scipy libraries and basic external libraries (math, random, etc.)

- input: *.txt file parsed as 2nd arg to program
- output: *_out.txt file with 1 for possible, 0 for impossible
